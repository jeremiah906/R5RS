The map() function applies a function to every member of an iterable and returns the result. Lambda is a single expression anonymous function often used as an inline function. Lambda can be used inside a list and dictionary.

The fib_list which is taken already has 0 and 1. Then in the next iteration, this will be used as input, and the result of their sum will append to the list.
